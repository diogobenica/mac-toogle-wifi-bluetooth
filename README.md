Toggle your wifi and bluetooth on and off in Spotlight

# Instalation
Download the app here and put anywhere on your machine. I recomend put in iCloud Drive so when you setup a new Mac you already have the app.

# Usage
Spotlight will index the app and by hitting Cmd+Spacebar you can enter any part of ToogleWifiBluetooth and hit enter to toogle.
