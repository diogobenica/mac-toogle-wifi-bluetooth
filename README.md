Toggle your wifi and bluetooth on and off in Spotlight

# Instalation
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/diogobenica/mac-toogle-wifi-bluetooth/releases/download/v1.0.0/ToogleWifiBluetooth.zip), unzip and put the app anywhere on your machine. I recommend put in iCloud Drive so when you setup a new Mac you already have the app.

# Usage
Spotlight will index the app and by hitting Cmd+Spacebar you can enter any part of "ToogleWifiBluetooth" and hit enter to toogle.
